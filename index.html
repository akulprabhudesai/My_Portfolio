The internet has become the integral part of people of present generation and has touched every aspect of our lives. During my undergrad studies, first time I worked in a team environemnt, for my Final year project, where I came across a situation in which, none of my team member were having knowledge required to design software for our project and hence ready to take responsibility of designing it. This is the time when I accepted this challenge, and took the entire responsibility of desiging the software for our project. This is the first time when I came across software development field.</p><p class=about-wrapper__info-text>I always knew that technology has the power to change lifes of people from present as well as future. Since, I had just tested the feel this power along with realisation of my two biggest strenghts: strong dedication and hunger to face and overcome challenges, I embraced Computer Science and decided to persue Master's degree in Computer Science field.</p><p class=about-wrapper__info-text>That's where my inspiration, hunger and dream stands tall.</p><p class=about-wrapper__info-text>With a keen interest in working on the latest software technologies, I seek to take advantage of the plethora of opportunities in the field of software development which allows the tailoring of these technologies with one's creative instincts. Having acquired a solid foundation in the field of computer science through rigorous studies, along with my internships and projects in the software development industry, now I feel that it is the right time to solidify this base and expand my horizons in the Computer Science world.</p><span class="d-flex mt-3"><a target=_blank class="cta-btn cta-btn--resume" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gutRIxvFI6585dWtVq4MW7kbTLSnCWQF/view?usp=sharing">View Resume</a></span></div></div></div></div></section><section id=projects><div class=container><div class=project-wrapper><h2 class="section-title dark-blue-text">Projects</h2><div class=row><div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12"><div class=project-wrapper__text><h3 class=project-wrapper__text-title>Z-Mart</h3><div><p class=mb-4>Z-Mart is a e-commerce website which provides users a fast, safe, secure and easy platform to buy products over internet.
